            <p>
                Throughout the month of August, I visited the Philippines and reunited with family that I hadn't seen in over 13 years. We visited locations that had breathtaking views of volcanoes and just landscaping in general. It was very heartwarming to visit and spend time with family that I had not seen since I was 4 years old. I definitely can't wait to visit home again!
