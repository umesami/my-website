        <article>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is James Salac and I have been attending Cal Poly Pomona for 1 year now making this my sophomore year at the university. I am a Computer Science major and an interesting fact about me is that I have 2 dogs named Brutus and Saber. The first one is a German Shepherd while the other one is a small mixed white dog. I am a computer science major because I have an interest in computers and technology and how things work.</p>

            <p>
                Throughout the month of August, I visited the Philippines and reunited with family that I hadn't seen in over 13 years. We visited locations that had breathtaking views of volcanoes and just landscaping in general. It was very heartwarming to visit and spend time with family that I had not seen since I was 4 years old. I definitely can't wait to visit home again!
